        <h3>Introduction</h3>
        <p>
          Should you go all in on Instagram? Maybe place half of your social
          media budget into Facebook and split the rest between YouTube and
          LinkedIn? What about Pinterest? These are the kinds of questions
          plaguing small businesses and marketing teams alike. To help you
          decide which social media platforms are going to be right for your
          brand this year, here are our picks for the top social media sites you
          should care about in 2021.

          Whether you are a seasoned social media marketer, a marketer looking
          to venture into social media marketing, or a business owner looking to
          leverage on social media, it’s helpful to know the most popular social
          media sites around. This will allow you to maximize your brand reach
          on social media, engage with the right people, and achieve your social
          media goals. Of course, it isn’t only about the size of the social
          media sites. It’s also whether the social media site is a right fit
          for your business and you. Does it fit your brand image? Is your
          target audience using that social media site? How many social media
          sites can you manage at once? To make things easier for you, I did
          some research and compiled information about the 21 top social media
          sites in 2018. Some will be familiar to you, others might sound
          foreign to you. It might be worth reading more about the social media
          sites that might be great for your brand but that you have not
          explored.

              Long the home of influencers, brands, bloggers, small business
              owners, friends and everyone in between, Instagram has topped well
              over 1 billion monthly users. If you’re wondering whether a
              meaningful segment of your audience spends time on the platform,
              the answer is almost surely a resounding yes. Who’s on Instagram
              (and Why): Instagram has become one of the most popular social
              media platforms for teens and young adults, especially in the U.S.
              Use of the app slowly drops off with age but stays consistent
              across both men and women, so if your customers are under 40, then
              Instagram can’t be ignored. The Content that Works Best on
              Instagram: Beautiful photography, stunning visuals, unique
              designs, selfie-style video that speaks directly to your audience
              and a cohesive theme to your content will help you stand out on
              Instagram. You Should Prioritize Instagram if: Your target
              audience is under the age of 40, you run a lifestyle, ecommerce,
              or photography business.

              Facebook is the biggest social media site around, with more than
              two billion people using it every month. That’s almost a third of
              the world’s population! There are more than 65 million businesses
              using Facebook Pages and more than six million advertisers
              actively promoting their business on Facebook, which makes it a
              pretty safe bet if you want to have a presence on social media.
              It’s easy to get started on Facebook because almost all content
              format works great on Facebook — text, images, videos, live
              videos, and Stories. But note that the Facebook algorithm
              prioritizes content that sparks conversations and meaningful
              interactions between people, especially those from family and
              friends. If you want to learn more about succeeding with the
              updated Facebook algorithm, Brian Peters, our Strategic
              Partnership Marketer, shared the secrets of the new algorithm and
              what you can do to thrive on Facebook. Also, remember to optimize
              your content for mobile as 94 percent of Facebook’s users access
              Facebook via the mobile app.

              Twitter is a social media site for news, entertainment, sports,
              politics, and more. What makes Twitter different from most other
              social media sites is that it has a strong emphasis on real-time
              information — things that are happening right now. For example,
              one of the defining moments in the Twitter history is when Janis
              Krums tweeted the image of a plane that landed in the Hudson River
              when he was on the ferry to pick the passengers up. Another unique
              characteristic of Twitter is that it only allows 280 characters in
              a tweet (140 for Japanese, Korean, and Chinese), unlike most
              social media sites that have a much higher limit. Twitter is also
              often used as a customer service channel. According to advertisers
              on Twitter, more than 80 percent of social customer service
              requests happen on Twitter. And Salesforce calls Twitter “the New
              1-800 Number for Customer Service“. There are many social media
              customer service tools, such as Buffer Reply, available now to
              help you manage social customer service conversations.
