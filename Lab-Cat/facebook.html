          Should you go all in on Instagram? Maybe place half of your social
          media budget into Facebook and split the rest between YouTube and
          LinkedIn? What about Pinterest? These are the kinds of questions
          plaguing small businesses and marketing teams alike. To help you
          decide which social media platforms are going to be right for your
          brand this year, here are our picks for the top social media sites you
          should care about in 2021.

          Whether you are a seasoned social media marketer, a marketer looking
          to venture into social media marketing, or a business owner looking to
          leverage on social media, it’s helpful to know the most popular social
          media sites around. This will allow you to maximize your brand reach
          on social media, engage with the right people, and achieve your social
          media goals. Of course, it isn’t only about the size of the social
          media sites. It’s also whether the social media site is a right fit
          for your business and you. Does it fit your brand image? Is your
          target audience using that social media site? How many social media
          sites can you manage at once? To make things easier for you, I did
          some research and compiled information about the 21 top social media
          sites in 2018. Some will be familiar to you, others might sound
          foreign to you. It might be worth reading more about the social media
          sites that might be great for your brand but that you have not
          explored.
