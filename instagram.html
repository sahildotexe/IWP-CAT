        <h3>Instagram</h3>
        <p>
          Instagram[a] is an American photo and video sharing social networking
          service founded by Kevin Systrom and Mike Krieger. In April 2012,
          Facebook Inc. acquired the service for approximately US$1 billion in
          cash and stock. The app allows users to upload media that can be
          edited with filters and organized by hashtags and geographical
          tagging. Posts can be shared publicly or with pre-approved followers.
          Users can browse other users' content by tags and locations and view
          trending content. Users can like photos and follow other users to add
          their content to a personal feed.[10] Instagram was originally
          distinguished by only allowing content to be framed in a square (1:1)
          aspect ratio with 640 pixels to match the display width of the iPhone
          at the time. In 2015, these restrictions were eased with an increase
          to 1080 pixels. The service also added messaging features, the ability
          to include multiple images or videos in a single post, and a 'stories'
          feature—similar to its main opposition Snapchat—which allows users to
          post photos and videos to a sequential feed, with each post accessible
          by others for 24 hours each. As of January 2019, the Stories feature
          is used by 500 million users daily.[10] Originally launched for iOS in
          October 2010, Instagram rapidly gained popularity, with one million
          registered users in two months, 10 million in a year, and 1 billion as
          of June 2018.[11] The Android version was released in April 2012,
          followed by a feature-limited desktop interface in November 2012, a
          Fire OS app in June 2014, and an app for Windows 10 in October 2016.
          As of October 2015, over 40 billion photos had been uploaded. Although
          praised for its influence, Instagram has been the subject of
          criticism, most notably for the negative impact on teens' mental
          health, policy and interface changes, allegations of censorship, and
          illegal or improper content uploaded by users.
